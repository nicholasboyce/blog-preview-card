## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I normally stick to flexbox because I'm more comfortable with it, but CSS Grid is really handy for defining the sizes of things without having to deal with "flex: 1" and all that. It's especially handy for pictures. I like it! And want to use it more going forward.

### Continued development

I'm really looking forward to creating easily customizable color palettes. Maybe users could even adjust how they want their page to look based on presets on one of my websites in the future!
